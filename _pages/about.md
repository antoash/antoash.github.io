Hi! Iâ€™m an Electrical and Electronics Engineering graduate focused on developing my expertise in embedded systems and low-level C programming with STM32 microcontrollers. I am also actively researching the design of power converters with Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithms for photovoltaic systems.  
  
I graduated with a Bachelor's in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Manipal Institute of Technology in 2023. During my studies, I had the privilege of conducting research under Dr. Rahul Ratnakumar on Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles and Dr. Shweta Vincent on Genetic Algorithms.   
  
In the summer of 2022, I worked at ECIS LLC as an Operation Maintenance Intern, where I deepened my understanding of Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs). My responsibilities included:  
- PCB Repairs: Identifying and replacing faulty components.    
- Design Assembly: Dismantling drives into individual components for inspection, testing, and repair.  
- Testing: Conducting performance and functionality tests on drive units to ensure effective repairs.  

My interests include power electronics and embedded systems. In my free time, I enjoy reading [check out my reading list], playing basketball and working on my blog. If you are interested in collaborating, please feel free to contact me!
